## Problem 1

First, clean the data in *pols-month.csv*.

``` r
pols_df =
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(mon,sep = "-", into = c("year","month","day")) |> 
  mutate(
    month = case_match(
      month,
      "01" ~ "Jan",
      "02" ~ "Feb",
      "03" ~ "Mar",
      "04" ~ "Apr",
      "05" ~ "May",
      "06" ~ "Jun",
      "07" ~ "Jul",
      "08" ~ "Aug",
      "09" ~ "Sep",
      "10" ~ "Oct",
      "11" ~ "Nov",
      "12" ~ "Dec"
    ) ) |> 
  mutate(
    president = case_match(
      prez_gop,
      1 ~ "gop",
      2 ~ "gop",
      0 ~ "dem"
  )) |> 
   select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop,-day)
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon

Cleaned pol-month dataset contains 822 observations of 9 variables
related to the number of national politicians who are democratic or
republican at any given time from 1947 to 2015.The variable *president*
represents their partisanship.

Second, clean the data in *snp.csv* using a similar process to the
above.

``` r
snp_df =
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(date,sep = "/", into = c("month","day","year")) |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    year = ifelse(year>=50, 1900+year, 2000+year)
  ) |> 
  relocate(year,month) |> 
  mutate(
    month = case_match(
      month,
      "1" ~ "Jan",
      "2" ~ "Feb",
      "3" ~ "Mar",
      "4" ~ "Apr",
      "5" ~ "May",
      "6" ~ "Jun",
      "7" ~ "Jul",
      "8" ~ "Aug",
      "9" ~ "Sep",
      "10" ~ "Oct",
      "11" ~ "Nov",
      "12" ~ "Dec"
    ) ) |> 
  select(-day)
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Cleaned snp dataset contains 787 observations of 3 variables related to
Standard & Poor’s stock market index (S&P), often used as a
representative measure of stock market as a whole,from 1950 to 2015. The
varibale *close* represents the closing values of the S&P stock index on
the associated date.

Third, tidy the *unemployment data* so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets.

``` r
unemploy_df =
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") |>
    pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month", 
    values_to = "unemploy_rate"
  ) |> 
    janitor::clean_names() |> 
    mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) 
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Cleaned unemployment dataset contains 816 observations of 3 variables
related to the unemployment rate in any given month from 1948 to 2015.

Finally,join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging
unemployment into the result.

``` r
result_df =
  pols_df |> 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) |> 
  left_join(snp_df, by = join_by(year,month)) |> 
  left_join(unemploy_df, by = join_by(year,month))
```

The result dataset contains 822 observations of 11 variables related all
three parts of information above (including partisianship, S&P,
unemployment rate) in any given month from 1947 to 2015.

## Problem 2

First, read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
mr_df =
  readxl::read_excel("trashwheel_datasets/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",range = "A2:N550") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 /30,
    name = "mr"
  )
```

Next, use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda

``` r
professor_df =
  readxl::read_excel("trashwheel_datasets/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",range = "A2:M97") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 /30,
    name = "professor"
  )
```

``` r
gwynnda_df =
  readxl::read_excel("trashwheel_datasets/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",range = "A2:K110") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 /30,
    name = "gwynnda"
  )
```

Finally, combine these three dataset to produce a single tidy dataset

``` r
trashwheel_df =
  bind_rows(mr_df,professor_df,gwynnda_df) 
```

The resulting `trashwheel_df` dataset is a combination of 3 datasets
*Mr. Trash Wheel*, *Professor Trash Wheel*, and *Gwynnda Trash Wheel* .
In total, the `trashwheel_df` dataset contains747 observations of 16
variables, among which the `name` variable represent the trash wheel’s
name. The resulting dataset contains 547 observations from *Mr. Trash
Wheel* dataset, 94 observations from *Professor Trash Wheel* dataset,
and 106 observations from *Gwynnda Trash Wheel* dataset. The resulting
dataset contains key variables such as data (following `month`, `year`,
`date` variables), and the workload of each trashwheel at a specific
data (including the weight and volume of trash it collected
`weight_tons` and `volume_cubic_yards`). It also contains amount of
specific kind of trash that each trashwheel collected:
`plastic_bottles`,`polystyrene`,`cigarette_butts`, `glass_bottles`,
`grocery_bags`, `chip_bags`, `sports_balls` (which is only collected by
Mr.Trash Wheel), `plastic_bags`(which is only collected by Gwynnda Trash
Wheel). It also contains the (approximate) number of homes powered,
`homes_powered`.

Q: For available data, what was the total weight of trash collected by
Professor Trash Wheel? A: The total weight of trash collected by
Professor Trash Wheel is 190.12 Q:What was the total number of cigarette
butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021? A: The total number of
cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is 1.63^{4}
